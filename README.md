### Genome selection

The ~5k sequencing runs on the SRA were initialy filtered before being assembled. Runs which did not have at least 100x coverage of the genome (approximately 400Mb raw sequence data) were excluded. In a small number of cases (<20), runs were excluded that had more than 1000x coverage in order for speedy proccessing.
